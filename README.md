## 🖥️ Interface Preview

## 🛠️ Project Overview

**WildfireGuard AI** is a real-time computer vision application designed to analyze video streams for smoke signatures and thermal anomalies indicative of forest fires. Built with **Streamlit** and **TensorFlow**, it features a responsive "Command Center" UI with simulated telemetry and live inference logging.

### Key Features
* **Real-Time Inference:** Frame-by-frame analysis using a custom-trained CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).
* **Dynamic Confidence Control:** Adjustable sensitivity threshold via the sidebar to reduce false positives.
* **Immersive UI:** Custom CSS styling with a futuristic, dark-mode aesthetic (Neon Red/Orange).
* **Live Telemetry:** Simulated dashboard metrics for wind, ping, and area coverage.
* **System Logs:** Scrolling terminal-style logs tracking detection events and timestamps.
* **Safety Mechanisms:** Automatic temporary file cleanup and user-controlled stop functionality.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Core Logic:** Python 3.10
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Custom CSS injected)
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV (cv2)
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Data Manipulation:** NumPy

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Safae26/WildfireGuard-AI.git](https://github.com/Safae26/WildfireGuard-AI.git)
cd WildfireGuard-AI
```
### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: Ensure you have the forest_fire.keras model file in the root directory.
### 4. Run the System
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧠 Model Architecture
The system utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of satellite forest fire imagery. The model performs binary classification:
- Preprocessing: Frames are resized to (350, 350) and normalized.
- Inference: The model outputs a probability score (0.0 - 1.0).
- Thresholding: If Probability > Threshold (default 0.5), the system triggers a CRITICAL ALERT.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
- Integration with live satellite API feeds.
- GPS coordinate mapping for detected fires.
- SMS/Email alert notifications via Twilio or SMTP.
- YOLOv8 implementation for bounding-box localization.
